## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[HotelManagementSystem Code of Conduct](blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to <ehsanul.siamdev@gmail.com>.


## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation]().

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

<!--
You might want to create a separate issue tag for questions and include it in this description. People should then tag their issues accordingly.

Depending on how large the project is, you may want to outsource the questioning, e.g. to Stack Overflow or Gitter. You may add additional contact and information possibilities:
- IRC
- Slack
- Gitter
- Stack Overflow tag
- Blog
- FAQ
- Roadmap
- E-Mail List
- Forum

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (Traceback)
  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <ehsanul.siamdev@gmail.com>.
<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for bugs and errors that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->


### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for HotelManagementSystem, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation]() carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux. <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most HotelManagementSystem users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for enhancement suggestions that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->

### Your First Code Contribution
To make your first code contribution to the HotelManagementSystem project, follow these steps:

1. Set up your development environment by installing the required tools and dependencies. Refer to the project's documentation for instructions on how to set up the development environment.

2. Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/EhsanulHaqueSiam/HotelManagementSystem.git
   ```

3. Create a new branch in the codebase with a branch name that includes your username and the issue number. For example, if your username is "johnsmith" and the issue number is 123, you can use the following command:

   ```
   git checkout -b johnsmith-123
   ```

4. Make the necessary changes or additions to the codebase based on the contribution you want to make. Ensure that your code follows the project's coding conventions and styleguides.

5. Test your changes locally to verify that they work as intended and do not introduce any regressions.

6. Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit them to your branch. Write a descriptive commit message using one of the following prefixes:

   - `feat`: for a new feature
   - `fix`: for a bug fix
   - `docs`: for changes in documentation
   - `style`: for everything related to styling
   - `refactor`: for code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
   - `test`: for everything related to testing
   - `chore`: for updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc.

   For example:

   ```
   git commit -m "feat: Add feature X to handle hotel bookings"
   ```

7. Push your branch to the remote repository on GitHub:

   ```
   git push origin johnsmith-123
   ```

8. Open a pull request on the project's GitHub repository. Provide a clear description of your contribution, including the problem it addresses or the feature it adds. The project maintainers will review your pull request and provide feedback or merge it into the main codebase.


## Styleguides

The HotelManagementSystem project likely has specific styleguides that outline the coding conventions and best practices to follow. These styleguides ensure consistency in the codebase and make it easier for developers to understand and maintain the code. To contribute to the project, it's essential to adhere to these styleguides.

1. Start by familiarizing yourself with the project's existing codebase. Take note of the coding conventions followed, such as indentation style, variable naming conventions, and file structure.

2. Read the project's documentation or CONTRIBUTING.md file for specific guidelines on coding style and conventions. It may include details on preferred programming languages, indentation rules, variable naming conventions, and other project-specific guidelines.

3. Use linting tools or code formatters specific to the project's programming language or framework. These tools automatically enforce styleguide rules and can help you identify and fix style issues in your code.

4. Pay attention to existing code patterns and follow them consistently to maintain code coherence across the project.

### Commit Messages

When making commits to the HotelManagementSystem project, it's important to write clear and descriptive commit messages. Good commit messages provide a concise summary of the changes and help others understand the purpose and context of the commit. Here are some tips for writing effective commit messages:

1. Keep the subject line of the commit message concise and descriptive. It should summarize the main purpose of the commit in around 50 characters.

2. Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature," "Fix bug," "Update documentation") to clearly indicate the type of change.

3. Provide additional details in the commit message body if necessary. This can include explaining why the change was made, referencing relevant issues or discussions, or providing any important context.

4. Use bullet points or paragraphs to structure the commit message body and make it easier to read.

5. If the commit addresses a specific issue or pull request, reference it using the appropriate syntax. For example, "Fixes #123" or "Closes PR #456."

6. Proofread your commit message for clarity, grammar, and punctuation.
